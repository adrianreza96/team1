FeastFreedom

FeastFreedom, a platform connecting consumers looking for homemade food to homemade service providers who cook food and provide delivery or pickup, is a responsive web-based application. 

In the meantime, there will be no payment processing involved in the application; instead, an email will be sent to the user and service provider at the time of a successful order placement.
